    "lyrics": "My tea's gone cold I'm wondering why I\nGot out of bed at all\nThe morning rain clouds up my window\nAnd I can't see at all\nAnd even if I could it'll all be gray\nPut your picture on my wall\nIt reminds me, that it's not so bad\nIt's not so bad\nMy tea's gone cold I'm wondering why I\nGot out of bed at all\nThe morning rain clouds up my window\nAnd I can't see at all\nAnd even if I could it'll all be gray\nPut your picture on my wall\nIt reminds me, that it's not so bad\nIt's not so bad\nDear Slim, I wrote you but still ain't callin'\nI left my cell, my pager, and my home phone at the bottom\nI sent two letters back in autumn, you must not-a got 'em\nThere probably was a problem at the post office or somethin'\nSometimes I scribble addresses too sloppy when I jot 'em\nBut anyways, fuck it, what's been up? Man how's your daughter?\nMy girlfriend's pregnant too, I'm 'bout to be a father\nIf I have a daughter, guess what I'm a call her?\nI'ma name her Bonnie\nI read about your Uncle Ronnie too I'm sorry\nI had a friend kill himself over some bitch who didn't want him\nI know you probably hear this everyday, but I'm your biggest fan\nI even got the underground shit that you did with Skam\nI got a room full of your posters and your pictures man\nI like the shit you did with Rawkus too, that shit was fat\nAnyways, I hope you get this man, hit me back,\nJust to chat, truly yours, your biggest fan\nThis is Stan\nMy tea's gone cold I'm wondering why I\nGot out of bed at all\nThe morning rain clouds up my window\nAnd I can't see at all\nAnd even if I could it'll all be gray\nPut your picture on my wall\nIt reminds me, that it's not so bad\nIt's not so bad\nDear Slim, you still ain't called or wrote, I hope you have a chance\nI ain't mad, I just think it's fucked up you don't answer fans\nIf you didn't wanna talk to me outside your concert\nYou didn't have to, but you coulda signed an autograph for Matthew\nThat's my little brother man, he's only six years old\nWe waited in the blistering cold for you\nFor four hours and you just said, \"No.\"\nThat's pretty shitty man, you're like his fuckin' idol\nHe wants to be just like you man, he likes you more than I do\nI ain't that mad though, I just don't like bein' lied to\nRemember when we met in Denver, you said if I'd write you you would write back\nSee I'm just like you in a way\nI never knew my father neither\nHe used to always cheat on my mom and beat her\nI can relate to what you're saying in your songs\nSo when I have a shitty day, I drift away and put 'em on\n'Cause I don't really got shit else so that shit helps when I'm depressed\nI even got a tattoo of your name across the chest\nSometimes I even cut myself to see how much it bleeds\nIt's like adrenaline, the pain is such a sudden rush for me\nSee everything you say is real, and I respect you 'cause you tell it\nMy girlfriend's jealous 'cause I talk about you 24/7\nBut she don't know you like I know you Slim, no one does\nShe don't know what it was like for people like us growin' up, you gotta call me man\nI'll be the biggest fan you'll ever lose\nSincerely yours, Stan\nP.S. we should be together too\nMy tea's gone cold I'm wondering why I\nGot out of bed at all\nThe morning rain clouds up my window\nAnd I can't see at all\nAnd even if I could it'll all be gray\nPut your picture on my wall\nIt reminds me, that it's not so bad\nIt's not so bad\nDear Mister \"I'm Too Good To Call Or Write My Fans\"\nThis will be the last package I ever send your ass\nIt's been six months and still no word, I don't deserve it?\nI know you got my last two letters, I wrote the addresses on 'em perfect\nSo this is my cassette I'm sending you, I hope you hear it\nI'm in the car right now, I'm doing 90 on the freeway\nHey Slim, I drank a fifth of vodka\nYou dare me to drive?\nYou know the song by Phil Collins, \"In the Air of the Night\"\nAbout that guy who could a saved that other guy from drowning\nBut didn't, then Phil saw it all, then at a a show he found him?\nThat's kinda how this is, you could a rescued me from drowning\nNow it's too late, I'm on a thousand downers now, I'm drowsy\nAnd all I wanted was a lousy letter or a call\nI hope you know I ripped all of your pictures off the wall\nI love you Slim, we coulda been together, think about it\nYou ruined it now, I hope you can't sleep and you dream about it\nAnd when you dream I hope you can't sleep and you scream about it\nI hope your conscience eats at you and you can't breathe without me\nSee Slim, shut up bitch! I'm tryin' to talk!\nHey Slim, that's my girlfriend screamin' in the trunk\nBut I didn't slit her throat, I just tied her up, see I ain't like you\n'Cause if she suffocates she'll suffer more, and then she'll die too\nWell, gotta go, I'm almost at the bridge now\nOh shit, I forgot, how am I supposed to send this shit out?\nMy tea's gone cold I'm wondering why I\nGot out of bed at all\nThe morning rain clouds up my window\nAnd I can't see at all\nAnd even if I could it'll all be gray\nPut your picture on my wall\nIt reminds me, that it's not so bad\nIt's not so bad\nDear Stan, I meant to write you sooner but I just been busy\nYou said your girlfriend's pregnant now, how far along is she?\nLook, I'm really flattered you would call your daughter that\nAnd here's an autograph for your brother\nI wrote it on the Starter cap\nI'm sorry I didn't see you at the show, I must of missed you\nDon't think I did that shit intentionally just to diss you\nBut what's this shit you said about you like to cut your wrists too?\nI say that shit just clownin' dog, come on, how fucked up is you?\nYou got some issues Stan, I think you need some counseling\nTo help your ass from bouncing off the walls when you get down some\nAnd what's this shit about us meant to be together?\nThat type of shit will make me not want us to meet each other\nI really think you and your girlfriend need each other\nOr maybe you just need to treat her better\nI hope you get to read this letter, I just hope it reaches you in time\nBefore you hurt yourself, I think that you'll be doin' just fine\nIf you relax a little, I'm glad I inspire you but Stan\nWhy are you so mad? Try to understand, that I do want you as a fan\nI just don't want you to do some crazy shit\nI seen this one shit on the news a couple weeks ago that made me sick\nSome dude was drunk and drove his car over a bridge\nAnd had his girlfriend in the trunk, and she was pregnant with his kid\nAnd in the car they found a tape, but they didn't say who it was to\nCome to think about, his name was, it was you\nDamn!"

a problem here\nYa'll act like you never seen a white person before\nJaws all on the floor like Pam, like Tommy just burst in the door\nAnd started whoopin' her ass worse than before\nThey first were divorced, throwin' her over furniture (Ahh)\nIt's the return of the, oh wait, no way, you're kidding\nHe didn't just say what I think he did, did he\nAnd Dr. Dre said, nothing you idiots\nDr. Dre's dead, he's locked in my basement (Haha)\nFeminist women love Eminem\nChicka-chicka-chicka Slim Shady, I'm sick of him\nLook at him, walkin' around, grabbin' his you-know-what\nFlippin' the you-know-who, yeah but he's so cute though\nYeah, I probably got a couple of screws up in my head loose\nBut no worse, than what's goin' on in your parents bedrooms\nSometimes I wanna get on TV and just let loose, but can't\nBut it's cool for Tom Green to hump a dead moose\nMy bum is on your lips, my bum is on your lips\nAnd if I'm lucky you might just give it a little kiss\nAnd that's the message that we deliver to little kids\nAnd expect them not to know what a woman's clitoris is\nOf course they're gonna know what intercourse is\nBy the time they hit fourth grade\nThey got the Discovery Channel don't they\nWe ain't nothin' but mammals\nWell, some of us are cannibals\nWho cut other people open like cantaloupes\nBut if we can hump dead animals and antelopes\nThen there's no reason that a man and another man can't elope\nBut if you feel like I feel, I got the antidote\nWomen wave your pantyhose, sing the chorus and it goes\nI'm Slim Shady, yes, I'm the real Shady\nAll you other Slim Shadys, are just imitating\nSo won't the real Slim Shady, please stand up\nPlease stand up, please stand up\n'Cause I'm Slim Shady, yes, I'm the real Shady\nAll you other Slim Shadys, are just imitating\nSo won't the real Slim Shady, please stand up\nPlease stand up, please stand up\nWill Smith don't gotta cuss in his raps to sell records\nWell I do, so fuck him and fuck you too\nYou think I give a damn about a Grammy\nHalf of you critics can't even stomach me\nLet alone stand me\nBut Slim, what if you win, wouldn't it be weird\nWhy, so you guys can just lie to get me here\nSo you can sit me here next to Britney Spears\nShit, Christina Aguilera better switch me chairs\nSo I can sit next to Carson Daly and Fred Durst\nAnd hear 'em argue over who she gave head to first\nLittle bitch put me on blast on MTV\nYeah he's cute, but I think he's married to Kim, hehe\nI should download her audio on mp3\nAnd show the whole world, how you gave Eminem VD (Ahh)\nI'm sick of you little girl and boy groups, all you do is annoy me\nSo I have been sent here to destroy you\nAnd there's a million of us just like me\nWho cuss like me, who just don't give a fuck like me\nWho dress like me, walk talk and act like me\nAnd just might be, the next best thing, but not quite me\n'Cause I'm Slim Shady, yes, I'm the real Shady\nAll you other Slim Shadys, are just imitating\nSo won't the real Slim Shady, please stand up\nPlease stand up, please stand up\n'Cause I'm Slim Shady, yes, I'm the real Shady\nAll you other Slim Shadys, are just imitating\nSo won't the real Slim Shady, please stand up\nPlease stand up, please stand up\nI'm like a head trip to listen to, 'cause I'm only givin' you\nThings you joke about with your friends inside your livin' room\nThe only difference is I got the balls to say it in front of ya'll\nAnd I don't gotta be false or sugar-coat it at all\nI just get on the mic and spit it\nAnd whether you like to admit it, I just shit it\nBetter than ninety percent of you rappers out can\nThen you wonder, how can kids eat up these albums like Valiums?\nIt's funny 'cause at the rate I'm goin' when I'm thirty\nI'll be the only person in the nursin' home flirting\nPinchin' nurses asses while I'm jackin' off with Jergens\nAnd I'm jerkin' but this whole bag of Viagra isn't workin'\nIn every single person there's a Slim Shady lurkin'\nHe could be workin' at Burger King, spittin' on your onion rings\nOr in the parkin' lot circling, screamin' I don't give a fuck\nWith his windows down and his system up\nSo will the real Shady, please stand up\nAnd put one of those fingers, on each hand up\nAnd be proud to be outta your mind and outta control\nAnd one more time loud as you can how does it go\nI'm Slim Shady, yes, I'm the real Shady\nAll you other Slim Shadys, are just imitating\nSo won't the real Slim Shady, please stand up\nPlease stand up, please stand up\n'Cause I'm Slim Shady, yes, I'm the real Shady\nAll you other Slim Shadys, are just imitating\nSo won't the real Slim Shady, please stand up\nPlease stand up, please stand up\n'Cause I'm Slim Shady, yes, I'm the real Shady\nAll you other Slim Shadys, are just imitating\nSo won't the real Slim Shady, please stand up\nPlease stand up, please stand up\n'Cause I'm Slim Shady, yes, I'm the real Shady\nAll you other Slim Shadys, are just imitating\nSo won't the real Slim Shady, please stand up\nPlease stand up, please stand up\nHaha, guess there's a Slim Shady in all of us\nFuck it, let's all stand up"

And look where it's at!\nMiddle America, now it's a tragedy\nNow it's so sad to see, an upper-class city\nHavin' this happenin'\nThen attack Eminem 'cause I rap this way\nBut I'm glad, 'cause they feed me the fuel that I need\nFor the fire to burn and it's burning, and I have returned\nAnd I am whatever you say I am\nIf I wasn't, then why would I say I am?\nIn the paper, the news, every day I am\nRadio won't even play my jam\n'Cause I am whatever you say I am\nIf I wasn't, then why would I say I am?\nIn the paper, the news, every day I am\nI don't know, it's just the way I am\nI'm so sick and tired of being admired\nThat I wish that I would just die or get fired\nAnd dropped from my label, let's stop with the fables\nI'm not gonna be able to top on \"My Name Is\"\nAnd pigeon-holed into some poppy sensation\nTo cop me rotation at rock-n-roll stations\nAnd I just do not got the patience\nTo deal with these cocky Caucasians\nWho think I'm some wigger who just tries to be black\n'Cause I talk with an accent, and grab on my balls\nSo they always keep asking the same fucking questions\nWhat school did I go to, what hood I grew up in\nThe why, the who, what, when, the where and the how\n'Til I'm grabbing my hair and I'm tearin' it out\n'Cause they driving me crazy, I can't take it\nI'm racin', I'm pacin', I stand and I sit\nAnd I'm thankful for every fan that I get\nBut I can't take a shit in the bathroom\nWithout someone standing by it\nNo, I won't sign you an autograph\nYou can call me an asshole, I'm glad, 'cause...\nI am whatever you say I am\nIf I wasn't, then why would I say I am?\nIn the paper, the news, every day I am\nRadio won't even play my jam\n'Cause I am whatever you say I am\nIf I wasn't, then why would I say I am?\nIn the paper, the news, every day I am\nI don't know, it's just the way I am"
